== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the post type for pending? =

Yes, via filters. You can filter `dashboard_pending_review_post_type` and change the post type to any valid post type or `any`, which will show all pending posts in all post types.

= Can I change the default number of posts shown? =

Yes, via (you guessed it) filters.

= Didn't this plugin used to be owned by Viper007Bond? =

Yes. Alex was fighting leukemia and the cancer won in 2019. Instead of letting this plugin wallow, I adopted it.
